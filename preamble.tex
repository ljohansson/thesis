	The research presented in this thesis was mainly performed at the Department of Genetics, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands. Part of the work in this thesis was financially supported by ZONMW, grant no 40-41200-98-9159, Netherlands CardioVascular Research Initiative (CVON2011–19; Genius), and the Netherlands Organization or Scientific Research (NOW) VIDI grant number 917.164.455 received by Morris A. Swertz.

	Printing of this thesis was financially supported by Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen.

	Cover design and layout by L.F. Johansson.
	The front cover shows a variant that can only be seen when looking through the noise created by the four DNA nucleotides A, C, G and T.

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item Depending on how samples are prepared and analyzed, next-generation sequencing is suitable for detection of both base-level variants and structural variants. \textsl{(this thesis)}
	
	\item High coverage next-generation sequencing data is suitable for single-exon copy number variation detection. \textsl{(this thesis)}
	
	\item Before biological variability can be detected in next-generation sequencing, first laboratory induced variability has to be minimalized \textsl{(this thesis)}
	
	\item International screening program criteria  are currently not fully met for opportunistic genetic screening.\textsl{(this thesis)}
	
	\item In non-invasive prenatal testing, the use of multiple independent models increases the reliability of  the prediction of presence of a trisomy from a single data set. \textsl{(this thesis)}
	
	\item The same measurement outcome in non-invasive prenatal testing gives different results for women with different prior risks of carrying a child with a trisomy. \textsl{(this thesis)}
	
	\item Noise is everything that, from a certain perspective, blocks the path between reality and measurement outcome. \textsl{(this thesis)}
	
	\item Data can be of high and low quality at the same time (depending on what information should be retrieved from the data). \textsl{(this thesis)}
	
	\item Understanding how or why is seldom as useful as understanding that things are. \textsl{(Robin Hobb, Fool's Assassin)}
	
	\item It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see. \textsl{(Henry David Thoreau)}
